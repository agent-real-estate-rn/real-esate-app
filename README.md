# Final Project - *My Agent*

**My Agent** is a rental property search app.

## Description of App

In order to find a rental property in Ho Chi Minh, a user must search through facebook, craigslist, websites, and mobile apps in addition to getting an agent working for them. "My Agent" app intends to resolve this by taking over the role of an agent and provide the user relevant and real time updates as soon as new listings are posted in a addition to current listings based on user search criteria and location. A typical use case is when user knows in advance for example 1 month, they will need to move out. They can create a 'subscription' and rest assured they will keep getting the most up to date listings without having to constantly check their app and multiple other websites.

## Concerns and thoughts

- How will landlord and tenant contact each other when there is a match? Phone, email, instant messaging?
- How to keep landlords and agents from posting duplicate property listings?
- Should there be a limit to how many property posts user can make in day?
- Will there be a vetting process to prevent spam and fake postings? How can this be done?
